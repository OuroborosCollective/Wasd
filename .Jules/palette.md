## 2025-05-15 - [Accessibility & Feedback in Status Bars]
**Learning:** Adding `role="progressbar"` with scaled ARIA values and a conditional `animate-pulse` class for low-health states provides both assistive technology support and better visual situational awareness without cluttering the UI. Semantic `<kbd>` tags should be used consistently for all keyboard shortcuts to maintain a high level of document structure.
**Action:** Always verify if status bars have ARIA roles and if low-state warnings (like <20% health) are visually indicated by animations. Use `<kbd>` for all single-key interaction hints.

## 2025-05-15 - [Accessibility in HUD Overlays]
**Learning:** HUD components in complex game interfaces often use purely decorative icons and custom-styled progress bars that are invisible to screen readers. Adding `role="progressbar"` with scaled ARIA values and marking decorative icons with `aria-hidden="true"` significantly improves the experience for assistive technology users without changing the visual design.
**Action:** Always verify that any visual "meter" or "bar" has a corresponding ARIA role and that all icon-only decorative elements are hidden from the accessibility tree.

## 2028-02-14 - [Quest Tracker Accessibility]
**Learning:** Progress bars in objective trackers are often purely visual. Implementing the WAI-ARIA `progressbar` pattern with `aria-valuetext` for percentage-based progress ensures that screen reader users can track mission objectives with the same precision as sighted players.
**Action:** Always wrap visual progress indicators in Quest or Objective trackers with `role="progressbar"` and provide both raw (`aria-valuenow`) and human-readable (`aria-valuetext`) progress values.

## 2026-07-14 - [Pulsing Visual Alerts for Vitals]
**Learning:** Visual-only pulsing animations for low health/stamina (<20%) can be distracting for users with vestibular sensitivities. Combining these animations with `prefers-reduced-motion` fallbacks (e.g., static high-contrast filters) and matching `aria-valuetext` updates ensures the alert is inclusive and accessible.
**Action:** When implementing "danger" states via animation, always include a `@media (prefers-reduced-motion: reduce)` block that provides a static visual alternative.
