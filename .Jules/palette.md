## 2025-05-15 - [Accessibility & Feedback in Status Bars]
**Learning:** Adding `role="progressbar"` with scaled ARIA values and a conditional `animate-pulse` class for low-health states provides both assistive technology support and better visual situational awareness without cluttering the UI. Semantic `<kbd>` tags should be used consistently for all keyboard shortcuts to maintain a high level of document structure.
**Action:** Always verify if status bars have ARIA roles and if low-state warnings (like <20% health) are visually indicated by animations. Use `<kbd>` for all single-key interaction hints.

## 2025-05-15 - [Accessibility in HUD Overlays]
**Learning:** HUD components in complex game interfaces often use purely decorative icons and custom-styled progress bars that are invisible to screen readers. Adding `role="progressbar"` with scaled ARIA values and marking decorative icons with `aria-hidden="true"` significantly improves the experience for assistive technology users without changing the visual design.
**Action:** Always verify that any visual "meter" or "bar" has a corresponding ARIA role and that all icon-only decorative elements are hidden from the accessibility tree.

## 2028-02-14 - [Quest Tracker Accessibility]
**Learning:** Progress bars in objective trackers are often purely visual. Implementing the WAI-ARIA `progressbar` pattern with `aria-valuetext` for percentage-based progress ensures that screen reader users can track mission objectives with the same precision as sighted players.
**Action:** Always wrap visual progress indicators in Quest or Objective trackers with `role="progressbar"` and provide both raw (`aria-valuenow`) and human-readable (`aria-valuetext`) progress values.

## 2028-02-21 - [NPC Interaction Menu Shortcuts]
**Learning:** Keyboard shortcut hints inside highly interactive menus (e.g. `NpcInteractionMenu`) benefit greatly from using semantic `<kbd>` tags with dynamic color-adaptation on hover/selection rather than static generic `div` tags. Using dynamic borders/text matching the active item's color scheme increases visibility while maintaining sharp brutalist boundaries.
**Action:** Utilize dynamically-styled `<kbd>` tags (with `aria-hidden="true"` when redundant with `aria-keyshortcuts`) in brutalist menu list items to preserve the high-tech, diamond-glass aesthetic without losing document-level structural semantics.
