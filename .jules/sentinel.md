## 2025-05-15 - [Critical] Unprotected Admin Mount Points
**Vulnerability:** The `/api/client2d-assets` and `/api/sovereign/deploy` administrative routers were mounted in `ServerBootstrap.ts` without authentication middleware, exposing sensitive system information and potentially dangerous actions.
**Learning:** Mounting administrative routers without top-level middleware creates security gaps where info-leaking endpoints (like `/truth`) remain unprotected even if write operations are individually guarded.
**Prevention:** Always apply `adminAuthMiddleware` at the `app.use()` mount point in `ServerBootstrap.ts` for any administrative or system-level router.
