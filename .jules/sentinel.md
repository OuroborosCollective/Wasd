## 2025-05-15 - [Critical] Unprotected Admin Mount Points
**Vulnerability:** The `/api/client2d-assets` and `/api/sovereign/deploy` administrative routers were mounted in `ServerBootstrap.ts` without authentication middleware, exposing sensitive system information and potentially dangerous actions.
**Learning:** Mounting administrative routers without top-level middleware creates security gaps where info-leaking endpoints (like `/truth`) remain unprotected even if write operations are individually guarded.
**Prevention:** Always apply `adminAuthMiddleware` at the `app.use()` mount point in `ServerBootstrap.ts` for any administrative or system-level router.

## 2025-05-22 - [High] Production Secret Enforcement
**Vulnerability:** Core auth services (LocalJwtService) allowed falling back to hardcoded development secrets even when running in production environments.
**Learning:** Development-friendly defaults can silently persist into production if not explicitly blocked by environment-aware logic.
**Prevention:** Enforce mandatory environment variables for all cryptographic secrets by throwing fatal errors during service initialization if they are missing in production.

## 2025-05-30 - [High] Unprotected AI Proxy and State Endpoints
**Vulnerability:** The `/science-mascot` endpoint was a public proxy for the Gemini AI API using a server-side secret, and `/resync` / `/snapshot` endpoints exposed full world state snapshots to unauthenticated users.
**Learning:** AI proxy endpoints that allow client-controlled system prompts are high-risk for both resource abuse and prompt injection. State snapshots are sensitive data that should always be guarded by authentication.
**Prevention:** Always apply `authMiddleware` to any endpoint that proxies external LLM APIs or returns comprehensive system/world state. Hardcode or strictly validate system prompts on the server.

## 2025-06-05 - [High] Insecure Player Identity and Time Manipulation in Warfront
**Vulnerability:** Warfront endpoints (/status, /contribute, /claim) allowed arbitrary `playerId` inputs and client-provided `now` timestamps, enabling any user to impersonate other players and bypass cycle-based time constraints.
**Learning:** Gameplay-critical endpoints often inherit loose development-time defaults (like `playerId` query params) that become severe vulnerabilities if not switched to server-authoritative resolution and hardened against client-provided metadata in production.
**Prevention:** Always use `resolveHttpPlayerIdentity` and enforce `authRequestHandler` on any endpoint that modifies player state or returns sensitive progression data. Explicitly disable client-provided timestamps in production logic.
